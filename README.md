## Project Overview

This repository contains the public files for our Practice Fusion EHR API integration, which enables us to build data extraction and reporting tools to better serve our patients and improve operational efficiency.

### What is this JWKS file?

The `jwks.json` file in this repository is a **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)** used for authenticating our application with Practice Fusion's FHIR API.


## Development Setup

1. **Generate RSA Key Pair** (2048-bit minimum)
2. **Update JWKS** with actual public key components
3. **Host JWKS** at publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint
4. **Register Application** with Practice Fusion PDS API
5. **Implement JWT Signing** for API authentication

## About Our Team

This integration is developed and maintained by volunteers and staff at the Yakima Free Clinic who are passionate about using technology to improve healthcare access and outcomes for our community.
